# 😂 React Joke Cards

This is a simple mini React project built early in my React learning journey.  
The app displays a list of joke cards — each with a joke question, its punchline, and a rating out of 10 — using reusable components and basic props.

## 🚀 Project Overview

> A minimal component-based app that renders a list of jokes using `.map()` and object destructuring.

Each card displays:
- Joke question  
- Joke punchline  
- Rating out of 10  

The joke data is stored separately in a JavaScript file and passed down to individual card components.

## 🧠 Purpose

This project was created to practice:
- Structuring **reusable components**
- Passing data via **props**
- Using **object destructuring**
- Rendering data with the **`.map()` method**

> 🗂️ _I recently found this project on my hard drive and decided to upload it to GitHub as part of documenting my early learning journey in React._
